> ### Overview

Created from scratch a **3D scene** with [Blender](https://www.blender.org) software. My 3D scene presents a realistic depiction of a breakfast in the dining room, inside a house. The scene includes objects with basic materials such as:

- Displacement mapping
- Bump mapping
- Transparency
- High reflectivity

Furthermore, my scene includes **fog**, **background image** and features such as:

- Rendering
- Lighting
- Animations:
  - **Keyframes** animation
  - **Physics** animation
  - **Shape Key** animation
